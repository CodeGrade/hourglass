# TODO

See [ANOMALIES.md](ANOMALIES.md) for anomaly checking TODOs.

- [ ] a single checkin endpoint
  - [ ] json blobs
    - [ ] snapshot
    - [ ] anomaly
- [x] professor iframe for viewing exam
- [x] a better during-exam flow for seeing anomalies occur and handling them quickly
- [ ] registration creation UI
- [ ] the `contents` page for an exam should not be accessible by any means unless the exam is being loaded into the `show` page. (`exams_controller.rb:36`)
  - [ ] encrypt the data on the `contents` page
  - [ ] client side decryption with PIN
  - [ ] login counter, so that PIN changes
- [x] `CodeTag` responses
- [x] initial files for `Code` responses, like a fill-in-the-blank
- [ ] validate the exam upload
  - [ ] every exam should have at least an `exam.yaml`
  - [x] filepicker code will not work if there are only empty directories [see here](https://github.com/CodeGrade/hourglass/commit/13677552dd95aefbcf64389adfd23cff5ddac7c1#commitcomment-33899283)
  - [ ] can get rid of `Upload` - exams should be able to handle their own files like `Registration`s do.
    - [ ] a bunch of code in `Upload` is taken from Bottlenose and is likely unnecessary.
- [ ] actually use SchemaChecker on uploaded exams' `exam.yaml`
- [ ] 6-digit PINs for students to check-in to exams based on exam salt and username
- [ ] notion of exam rooms
  - [ ] professor chooses the room they are in
  - [x] "finalize exam for this room"
    - [x] all submissions in *this* room are marked final, locking students out
- [x] a way to sign students out if they finish early
  - [x] finalize button for any submission that isnt final
- [ ] a way to check if students disconnect from the internet
  - [ ] show active sessions, if one is dropped, make an anomaly
- [x] files for the entire exam
- [ ] double check permissions for every controller action
  - [ ] allow proctors to view and absolve anomalies
- [ ] allow site admins to view any exam without a registration
  - [ ] there's some code in the exams controller that breaks if the user does not have an active registration for the exam
- [ ] find out if the exam network setup necessitates any changes to server
- [ ] "scratch space" for user taking exam
- [ ] export all final submissions as PDFs for manual grading
- [ ] export final submissions for each student, for upload to bottlenose for grading
  - [ ] bottlenose import feature
- [ ] download registrations (for a course) from bottlenose and upload them to hourglass (for an exam)
  - [ ] bottlenose endpoint (course#user_data [json]) for user info locked down to professors
- [x] only one session per user
  - [x] [devise - session limitable](https://github.com/devise-security/devise-security)
- [ ] exam creator/editor so YAML doesn't have to be involved at all
- [ ] make logo for favicon, readme, navbar
- [ ] grab student first and last names from LDAP?
- [ ] add a license
