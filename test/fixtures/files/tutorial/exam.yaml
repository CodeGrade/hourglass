    exam you take on Hourglass will have exam-wide instructions here, at the top of
    the page. </p><p>You may have less time to complete your exam than the exam is
    being offered: for example, you may be given three hours to complete the exam
    anywhere within a 24-hour window, say from noon Monday to noon Tuesday. Once you
    begin your exam, you have the given amount of time available to complete it...unless
    you wait until just before noon on Tuesday, in which case you will only have until
    noon.</p><p>Additionally, an exam might show some starter or reference code that's
    relevant to the whole exam, and it would be shown just below these instructions.</p>"
